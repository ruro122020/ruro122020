In 2023, I made a significant commitment and enrolled in a bootcamp, determined to master the ins and outs of what it takes to be a full-stack software engineer.
The experience was nothing short of exhilarating. I cherished every part of it, from the moments of frustration to the thrilling challenges of the projects I built along the way. It was a journey of self-discovery, constantly pushing my limits and expanding my boundaries.

Emerging from the bootcamp, I feel confident and eager to collaborate with other developers.
I have a burning desire to join a team that shares my passion for building software solutions that can make a
difference in the world, in society, and in our community for everyday people like you and me.
I'm now on the lookout for a team of developers where I can continue to grow my skills and embrace new
challenges. I value a healthy work-life balance and am ready to contribute to a great team.
If you are part of a fantastic team of developers seeking a software developer who has, and continues, to honed their technical skills, is
eager to learn and ask questions, doesn't shy away from a challenge, and loves developing software, let's [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-rojas-software-engineer/)!
